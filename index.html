        <p>Bangla
            Bangladeshi food is the brother of India’s Bengali cuisine and shares a similar past, cooking techniques and ingredients. However, it is not the same and food from Bangladesh has a distinct personality that makes it very different from that in India.

        <p>Our recipes primarily use fresh, unprocessed ingredients but we also believe there is a time and a place for canned, frozen, and other prepared ingredients. We believe in a diet that includes a wide variety of foods: real butter and cream, extra virgin olive oil, eggs, lots of fruits and vegetables, and protein from meat, fish, beans, and cheese. </p>
